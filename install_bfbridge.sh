# Classpath of "." and "/usr/lib/java/*" means look for Java classes in this folder
# (which contains:  org/camicroscope/*) and in /usr/lib/java/* (containing:
# bioformats package jar). So each element is a folder containing classes or a Jar file
# hence not "/usr/lib/java/", as this is a folder containing a Jar file, so neither.
javac -cp ".:/usr/lib/java/*" org/camicroscope/BFBridge.java

# pack into uncompressed Jar
jar c0f BfBridge.jar org/camicroscope/*.class

## Move them to a single directory
